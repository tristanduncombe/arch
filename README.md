# ARCH (A Recycling Centre Hub)   
Winner 2024 EAIT Hackathon

## Description | Problem Statement
Have you ever wanted to recycle those Monster Energy TM cans but there wasn't a container for change bin in sight? HOW USUAL OF THEM!!!! The distribution of the bins is sparse and lacking, in particular in places like UQ or other busy places. From cans on the ground to bottles in UQ lakes, all the way to trash in the ocean. WE NEED A SOLUTION!! This is where A.R.C.H. comes in. ARCH or A Recycling Centre Hub is going to innovate by revolutionising the way people recycle, ensuring convenient access to recycling stations, reducing waste and fostering a cleaner, healthier environment for all. Currently, the university has no incentive for people on campus to recycle recyclable materials.

## Size of Problem
It may seem like a small problem but continued negligence can result in masses of recyclable material heading to landfill, the ocean or even our very own  lake. 


## Solution
A.R.C.H. is a mobile application that allows users to find the nearest ARCH recycling bin, report full or missing bins, and earn recycling rewards. As part of our solution multiple ARCH bins will be placed all across the University. These bins allow users to earn rewards for recycling bottles and cans. The bins will also be smart bins capable of monitoring its waste level and alerting the relevant authorities. Bins will also handle the incoming materials and provide users with an NFC scan spot so that they can claim their reward. 


## How the solution works | Features
- Find the nearest recycling bin
    Containers for change bins are sparse and hard to find. Our app will show you the nearest recycling bin so you can recycle your waste responsibly.
- Report a bin
    If you see a bin that is full or missing, you can report it on the app. This way, we can help the community and the environment by making sure that recycling bins are always available and ready to use.
- Earn rewards
    By recycling, you can earn rewards that can be redeemed at participating stores. This will incentivize people to recycle and help reduce waste in the environment.


## Market Size
The market is not just everyone in UQ that cares about recycling. It involves the entire world.
